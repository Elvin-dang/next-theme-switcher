# Getting Started

`next-theme-switcher` is a lightweight, customizable component for toggling between light, dark, and system themes in React and Next.js apps.

<Steps>

### Install

```sh npm2yarn
npm i next-theme-switcher
```

### Import and Use

Add the `ThemeSwitcher` component anywhere in your app.

```tsx
"use client";

import { ThemeSwitcher } from "next-theme-switcher";
import { useState } from "react";
import "next-theme-switcher/styles";

export default function Example() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("system");

  return <ThemeSwitcher theme={theme} onThemeChange={setTheme} />;
}
```

**Integrate with "next-themes"**

If your app already uses next-themes, you can easily connect it:

```tsx
"use client";

import { ThemeSwitcher } from "next-theme-switcher";
import { useTheme } from "next-themes";
import "next-theme-switcher/styles";

export default function WithNextThemes() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();

  return <ThemeSwitcher theme={theme} onThemeChange={setTheme} />;
}
```

</Steps>
